- ✅ **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including HSTS, CSP, and frame protection
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Configurable API rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing with origin validation

## Security Configuration

### Enhanced Next.js Security Headers

```javascript
// Implemented in next.config.mjs
{
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Permissions-Policy': 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), interest-cohort=()',
  'Content-Security-Policy': 'default-src \'self\'; script-src \'self\' \'unsafe-inline\' \'unsafe-eval\' https://js.stripe.com; style-src \'self\' \'unsafe-inline\' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src \'self\' https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src \'self\' data: https: blob:; connect-src \'self\' https: wss:; frame-src \'self\' https://js.stripe.com; object-src \'none\'; base-uri \'self\'; form-action \'self\'; frame-ancestors \'none\'; upgrade-insecure-requests'
}
```

### Environment Variables Security

- ✅ Never commit secrets to version control
- ✅ Use `.env.local` for local development (gitignored)

### Security Middleware Implementation

All API routes now use our security middleware:

```typescript
import { withSecurity } from '@/lib/security-middleware'

export const POST = withSecurity(handler, {
  rateLimit: { maxRequests: 100, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 },
  requireCSRF: true,
  requireAuth: true,
  allowedOrigins: ['https://hausofbasquiat.com']
})
```

### Input Validation & Sanitization

Comprehensive security utilities implemented:

```typescript
import { 
  validateEmail, 
  validatePassword, 
  sanitizeInput,
  validateFileUpload,
  detectHarmfulContent 
} from '@/lib/security'

// Email validation with edge case handling
const isValid = validateEmail(userEmail)

// Password strength validation
const passwordResult = validatePassword(userPassword)
if (!passwordResult.isValid) {
  console.log(passwordResult.errors)
}

// Input sanitization
const cleanInput = sanitizeInput(userInput)

// File upload validation
const fileResult = validateFileUpload(uploadedFile)

// Harmful content detection
const contentResult = detectHarmfulContent(userContent)
```
