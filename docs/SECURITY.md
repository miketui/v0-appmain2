# Security Policy

## Overview

The Haus of Basquiat platform takes security seriously, especially given our commitment to protecting the LGBTQ+ ballroom community. This document outlines our security measures, policies, and procedures.

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Planned implementation for admin accounts
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication with proper expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin, Leader, Member, and Applicant roles
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeout

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: All data transmitted over HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input sanitization

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Scanned Docker images with minimal attack surface
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans of npm packages
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers implementation
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing

### Community Safety

- **Content Moderation**: AI-powered content scanning and human review
- **Reporting System**: Anonymous reporting for community safety
- **Harassment Prevention**: Proactive measures against harassment
- **Privacy Controls**: User control over profile visibility and data

## Security Configuration

### Next.js Security Headers

```javascript
// Implemented in next.config.js
{
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff', 
  'Referrer-Policy': 'origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Permissions-Policy': 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()',
  'Content-Security-Policy': 'default-src \'self\'; ...'
}
```

### Environment Variables Security

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Production secrets managed through deployment platforms
- Regular rotation of API keys and tokens

### Database Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Regular backups with encryption
- Access logging and monitoring
