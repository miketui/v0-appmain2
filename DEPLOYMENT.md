# 🚀 Haus of Basquiat - Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the complete Haus of Basquiat application to production.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project
- Railway account (or alternative hosting platform)
- Domain name (optional, for custom domain)

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Supabase)

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be fully provisioned
3. Note down your project URL and anon key from Settings > API

### 2. Run Database Schema

1. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute the schema
4. Copy and paste the contents of `database/setup-storage.sql`
5. Click "Run" to set up storage buckets and policies

### 3. Configure Authentication

1. Go to Authentication > Settings
2. Enable email authentication
3. Configure email templates (optional)
4. Set up custom SMTP (recommended for production)

### 4. Set up Row Level Security

The schema file includes all necessary RLS policies, but verify they're enabled:

1. Go to Database > Tables
2. Check that RLS is enabled for all tables
3. Verify policies are in place

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

# App Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME="Haus of Basquiat"
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
\`\`\`

### Backend Environment Variables

Create `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

\`\`\`bash
# Database
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Redis Cache (Optional)
UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=your-redis-url

PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
\`\`\`

## 🚂 Railway Deployment

### 1. Prepare for Deployment

1. Ensure all code is committed to a Git repository (GitHub recommended)
2. Test the application locally with production environment variables

### 2. Deploy Backend

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app) and create a new project
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select the backend directory as the root
4. Add all environment variables from the backend `.env` file
5. Deploy the service
6. Note the deployed URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.railway.app`)

### 3. Deploy Frontend

1. Create another service in the same Railway project
2. Connect the same repository but select the root directory
3. Add frontend environment variables
4. Update `CLIENT_URL` in backend environment to point to frontend URL
5. Deploy the frontend service

### 4. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Railway, go to your frontend service settings
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed
4. Update `VITE_APP_URL` and backend `CLIENT_URL` to use custom domain

## 🔄 Alternative Deployment Options

### Vercel (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)

**Frontend on Vercel:**
1. Import project from GitHub
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set output directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

**Backend on Railway:**
Follow the backend deployment steps above.

### Docker Deployment

**Frontend Dockerfile:**
\`\`\`dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
\`\`\`

**Backend Dockerfile:**
\`\`\`dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY backend/package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY backend/ .
EXPOSE 4000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
\`\`\`

## 🔒 Security Checklist
